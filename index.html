                Dance is a performing art. It is described in many ways. It is when people move to a musical rhythm. They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be an informal play, a part of a ritual, or a part of a professional performance. There are many kinds of dances, and every human society has its own dances.

                As with other performing arts, some people dance to express their feelings and emotions, or to feel better. Dance can be used to tell a story. In some societies, dance goes with song as well as music. Dancing is sometimes done as sport, and has similar athletic aspects. People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. It may take years of practice to become an experienced and capable dancer.
                To plan a dance is called choreography, done by a choreographer.[1] Often this goes with music, and fits into a certain style. Dances may be planned in detail, or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing. However, most dancing does follow some general style or pattern. One style is the couple dance, where (usually) a man and a woman dance together. Other dances need an ensemble, a group of people together to make it work.
                A lot of people love to dance. Dancing is very enjoyable. It also provides a healthy exercise. There are many types of challenging dances. Dancing is also a way to express or communicate personal feelings usually happiness and excitement. Dance can also have other meaning and purposes. For example, Indian dance has a specific purpose. When there is drought, people perform a dance called the “rain dance” this is believed to bring rain. Dance is passed down from generation to generation.
